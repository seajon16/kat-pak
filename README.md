* Updates to mods:

## Installation

### If you have v1.1 installed currently

* Remove `FarmersDelight-1.18.1-1.0.1.jar` from your `mods` folder.
* Download [the patch zip in this repo](./kat-pak-patch-v1.2.zip) and unzip the contents into your `mods` folder.
* **Note:** If you look at the server in your server list and see a message saying "Incompatible FML modded server: Server has additional mods that may be needed on the client", that's because I have a few extra server-side utility mods like `tpa`. You shouldn't run into any problems connecting to the server.

### If you have never installed this pack before

* Download and run [this launcher](https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.18.1-39.0.36/forge-1.18.1-39.0.36-installer.jar); you'll want a client installation.
* This should make a `mods` folder in your `.minecraft` folder (which is usually in `C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Roaming`), but if it doesn't, start up the Minecraft launcher, select the new forge profile, and run the game.
Once it loads, close it, and the `mods` folder should now be present.
* Lastly, you need the mods.
Download [the main zip in this repo](./kat-pak-v1.2.zip) and unzip the contents into your `mods` folder. It already includes [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads); no need to run any `jar` files.
* Launch Minecraft, and you should be good to go.
* **Note:** If you look at the server in your server list and see a message saying "Incompatible FML modded server: Server has additional mods that may be needed on the client", that's because I have a few extra server-side utility mods like `tpa`.

## About

As a disclaimer, this isn't a perfect representation of the modded Minecraft experience.
If you were to use a different, properly maintained pack, like any from [the FTB Team](https://feed-the-beast.com/), you'd have a much cleaner experience.
This is just me throwing together some packs that I think play nicely with each other.

If you're using my server to play this pack, I also have [these datapacks](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#MmNQ7l) from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/) installed.
You don't need to install these yourself, since they're all server-side, but I'm leaving there here in case you want to learn more about them:
* Experimental
  * Confetti creepers
* Hermitcraft
  * Wandering trades
* Mobs
  * Villager death messages
  * Double shulker shells
  * More mob heads
  * Dragon drops
* Items
  * Player head drops
* Survival
  * Villager workstation highlights
  * Multiplayer sleep
  * Graves
  * Custom nether portals
  * Armor statues
  * Unlock all recipes
  * Cauldron concrete

In addition, I would have [the end city datapack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/end-city-for-better-end-forge-port/) for the Better End mod, but it's only up to 1.17

## Notes for Server Admins

* I highly recommend [FTB Backups](https://media.forgecdn.net/files/3038/811/ftb-backups-2.1.1.6.jar), although it's not available for 1.18 yet
